We have two thermistors that we're going to model.
One is an epoxy-covered thermistor with long leads,
and the other is an automotive (Honda) coolant
temperature sensor. Neither has any technical
datasheet available. We'll enlist the Steinhart-Hart
equation to obtain accurate temperature readings.

The Steinhart–Hart equation is used to derive a precise
temperature of a thermistor, since it provides a closer
approximation to actual temperature than simpler equations,
and is useful over the entire working temperature range of
the sensor.

Steinhart–Hart coefficients are usually published by thermistor
manufacturers. Where Steinhart–Hart coefficients are not available,
they can be derived. Three accurate measures of resistance are
made at precise temperatures, then the coefficients are derived
by solving three simultaneous equations. The coefficients are
entered into the Steinhart equation to obtain actual temperature
